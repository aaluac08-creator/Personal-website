title: "Reflection on Uighur Culture"
excerpt: "Across generations, my family’s story traces an unbroken thread of perseverance and transformation. It began with a great-grandmother born into a nomadic life who settled in rural Kazakhstan in search of survival, followed by a grandfather who left the countryside to build a future in the city. The next chapter saw a father who, rooted in urban life, made the bold choice to move his family across continents. My own journey, moving to Canada at nine years old, continues this enduring pattern of seeking new horizons. It is a reminder that each generation’s courage to adapt shapes the foundation for the next, turning struggle into strength and change into opportunity."

Learning about Uighur culture helped me recognize the differences between the seen and unseen aspects of culture. Seen culture includes aspects of a culture that are visible, for example, language, clothing, food, daily customs, and art. In Uighur culture, seen components include the embroidered muqam that is performed and the Uighur language which is written in Arabic script, as well as traditional food such as rice pilaf and a traditional hat called doppa. These elements of culture are what a visitor coming to East Turkestan is likely to notice first. 

On the other hand, unseen culture are aspects like beliefs, values, political ideas, and social expectations. For Uighur people, these aspects of culture is profoundly influenced by Sunni Islam, the significance given to the family’s honour and hospitality, and very strong importance for retention of their culture. These unseen elements explain the endurance of Uighur people, especially considering their social and political challenges. Looking into these aspects made me have a more profound, respectful insight towards their culture.
 
The Uighur social system is built on the foundation of strong family ties and respect for the elderly. Men usually take charge of public and religious life while women take care of the family or work in agriculture or crafts. From an early age, uighur children are taught to respect customs and take part in doing house chores. Ethnic and religious identity form the basis of the social system.
 
Uighur people’s strategic geographic position on the Silk Road gives their economic system a historical basis in agriculture, trade, and traditional crafts. Local economies relied heavily on family farms and artisan workshops. However, today’s government policies, surveillance, and restricted access to resources and technology, especially in urban places, have changed the situation. While rural communities continue to depend on traditional cropping methods, many struggle with a lack of land and restrictive policies.
 
The relationship between social and economic systems is very prominent within Uighur culture. For example, family labour is not only the primary labor force, it is also crucial for the farming and crafts economy and therefore determines their sustenance. Meanwhile economic problems,such as limited land ownership and surveillance press on the traditional way of living. This shows that culture is dynamic, it’s shaped by both values and cicrcumstances.
 
Learning about Uighur culture was very fun and interesting for me and made it easier for me to understand the connections between seen and iunseen components as well as how social and
economic structures either help or jeopardize a culture's ability to be sustained. To truly appreciate the beauty of cultures like the Uighurs', it is crucial to understand these aspects. 

Warmly,
