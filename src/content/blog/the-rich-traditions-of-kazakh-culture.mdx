One of the most important early-life rituals in Kazakh culture is "tusau kesu," the ceremony held when a child takes their first steps. Cords are tied around the child's legs and ceremonially cut by a respected person, symbolizing that the child is free and supported as they begin walking through life. My own tusau kesu was performed by my grandfather, and even though I was too young to remember, the photos and retold stories make me feel proud and rooted in my heritage.

Another key rite is the Kazakh wedding tradition. Weddings can last several days and include many stages: from the engagement or matchmaking (kudalyk) where the groom's mother places earrings on the bride, to the betashar when the bride's face is revealed to the groom's relatives. These celebrations include blessings, traditional songs, and abundant food. They show how marriage is viewed not only as a union between two people, but also as a joining of families.

At funerals, memorial meals called "as" are hosted on the seventh, fortieth, one-hundredth day, and again on the first anniversary after a person's passing. My mother is preparing to attend my late aunt's first-year memorial soon. These gatherings bring the community together to pray, remember, and support the grieving family while blending cultural values and faith.

Hospitality is sacred in Kazakh culture. Guests are treated with great respect, offered the best food -- often beshbarmak -- and receive blessings from elders. Respect for elders is central, and in many families multiple generations live under the same roof.

Kazakh people also celebrate traditional holidays like Nauryz, the spring equinox. The celebration features traditional dress, music, and food such as nauryz kozhe. Families visit neighbors and relatives, share meals, and welcome the season as a fresh start.
