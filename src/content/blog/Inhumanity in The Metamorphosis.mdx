Many perceive Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis as an absurd story about inhumanity being presented by a man turning into a bug, but in reality I believe the true inhumanity in the novella was presented by the behaviour of the people closest to the bug. From the opening line, Kafka introduces the reader to Gregor Samsa’s transformation into a giant insect, “One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug”(Kafka, 1915). However, the physical change itself is not the true horror of the story. Instead, the real, ugly inhumanity lies in the actions of the closest people around Gregor, his family. As his family gradually withdraws empathy for him, this story shows how fragile human compassion truly can be. 
Ironically, Gregor does not become less morally human after his metamorphosis. He continues to think, feel guilt, love his family, and worry about their well-being. In reality Gregor’s humanity doesn’t change, the family's recognition of it does. Through guilt, isolation, dehumanizing language, violence, emotional abandonment, and finally emotional erasure after death, inhumanity can grow quietly even within the people that are supposed to be closest to you. The Metamorphosis ultimately shows that inhumanity does not necessarily always come from hatred or evil intentions, only the lack of empathy. 
The setting of the story is the main character’s family home, which emphasizes how inhumanity does not only exist in places outside of your comfort. It also can exist in familiar circles where moral responsibility and care should be the strongest. Gregor’s room was once a familiar, cozy space for him, but then became a symbol of isolation and abandonment. The home, which should be a place of safety and care, became a place of ultimate neglect. This contrast really emphasizes
Kafka’s portrayal of conditional empathy and shows how inhumanity is most ugly when it comes from those closest to us. 
Humanity as Conditional; Gregor Before the Transformation 
It’s established that Gregor’s humanity within his family is conditional long before his physical metamorphosis. Gregor’s value for the family is not rooted in who he is as a son or a person, but in what he provides financially for the family. He works a job he does not enjoy at all just to pay off his parents’ debts, sacrificing his own happiness and freedom. He admits so himself, “If I didn’t hold back for my parents’ sake, I would have quit ages ago.” (Kafka, 1915). This confession shows that Gregor has sacrificed his own quality of life just to help his family out. His existence is reduced to financial usefulness, which shows a sort of the family’s inhumanity that happened before Gregor’s transformation. 
This inhumanity extends beyond the family through Gregor’s workplace. When the manager arrives, he does not express concern for Gregor’s well-being. He immediately shouts at Gregor, accuses him of unreliability, and implies moral failure, seemingly not even considering illness. The manager’s behaviour makes it clear that Gregor is valued only as long as he remains economically reliable. Once his productivity is threatened, the empathy immediately vanishes. This interaction mirrors the family’s later treatment of Gregor and shows that their inhumane cruelty is a reflection of broader social values that equate human worth with usefulness. 
Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argues that modern society often prioritizes utility over human connection, making those who cannot contribute economically invisible (Bauman, 2000). Gregor embodies this condition perfectly. When he can work, he is accepted, when he cannot, he becomes an inconvenience. We as readers can see that by this conditional humanity before the transformation, it is clear that the metamorphosis ironically does not create inhumanity in Gregor, it exposes it from the closest people around him. The family’s later abandonment of Gregor was not sudden, it was the further extension of the behavior that has always valued him only for what he provides. 
Guilt as a Tool of Inhumanity
One of the saddest parts of Gregor’s story is his emotional response to his horrible situation being not anger, but guilt. After his transformation, Gregor isn’t angry at his family for their clear inhumane behavior towards him. Instead, he feels as if he himself inconveniences them. He worries constantly about inconveniencing his family, “he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.”(Kafka, 1915). Gregor feels responsibility for the discomfort of those around him, even as he himself is deprived of care. 
This guilt deepens Gregor’s dehumanization by preventing any self defense. He doesn’t ask for understanding or assistance, which he should have received as the bare minimum from his family, he literally adapts himself to his family’s emotional withdrawal. He hides under the sofa to avoid being seen, restricts his movement, and gradually stops eating to not be a burden. He suffers quietly because he believes it’s how it’s supposed to be. This terrible dynamic shows that inhumanity is sometimes very effective and normalized when it’s accepted without resistance. 
Gregor’s guilt enables his family’s cruelty. Because Gregor blames himself, his family is never forced to confront the moral consequences of their immoral behaviour. His tolerance allows the family’s inhumanity to appear reasonable to themselves, and not see themselves as cruel for it. In this perspective, we can see that inhumanity really is so successful when the victim feels the blame. Gregor’s guilt completes what his family began. 
This dynamic closely aligns with Brené Brown’s theory of shame. Brown argues that shame convinces individuals that they are fundamentally flawed and therefore deserving of mistreatment (Brown, 2012). Gregor’s guilt fits this exact argument. He perceives his metamorphosis as a personal failure due to which clear mistreatment to him is valid. His belief that he deserves abandonment reveals how deeply guilt has replaced any sense of self-worth. 
Gregor’s guilt shows the mechanics of how nuanced inhumanity can be. Gregor is not only extremely mistreated, he is conditioned to agree with his mistreatment. His family’s lack of empathy happens without any consequences because Gregor himself enforces it through blaming himself.
Loneliness Without Empathy 
Gregor’s isolation is the result of being shut out. He is literally locked in his room, not spoken to, and treated as a problem to manage. Gregor’s room slowly becomes empty, stripped of furniture and warmth, mirroring his emotional abandonment. His isolation is clearly systematic. 
This loneliness is especially cruel because Gregor is still emotionally present. He listens to conversations, wants to be included, and continues to care for his family. Yet no one treats as a human, and he receives zero empathy. Gregor’s loneliness is inhumane because he doesn’t have people who are supposed to empathize and support him do that. 
In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the main character Hamlet also feels emotionally isolated from people closest to him. Like Gregor, Hamlet experiences a deeply traumatic event, the sudden death of his father, yet finds himself emotionally abandoned by those closest to him. Nobody really supports or understands him, his family and friends dismiss his grief. Gertrude and Claudius minimize his mourning, and draw it out as excessive and irrational. 
Both Gregor and Hamlet suffer not because they lack others around them, but because those closest to them don’t empathize with them. Their pain is treated as an inconvenience. In Gregor’s case, his family withdraws support because his condition disrupts their comfort and routine. In Hamlet’s case, his grief threatens the political stability and emotional convenience of the court. In both stories, there's a lack of empathy due to self-interest. 
This parallel shows a shared critique of inhumanity: emotional abandonment following trauma. In both Gregor’s and Hamlet’s situations empathy from the closest people to them should grow, but instead it disappears. Kafka and Shakespeare’s books both show that loneliness can become extremely destructive when it is enforced by neglect. Denying empathy to someone close to you while they’re deeply suffering is a deeply inhumane form of cruelty. 
Loneliness in both Hamlet and The Metamorphosis really highlight inhumanity, but in contrast we can see that loneliness in Murat Nasyrov’s song يالغۇز قالدىم /Kaldym Yalguz/ I was left alone highlights humanity.
“ھەممىنى بىلمەي كەتتىنگ سەن 
You left without knowing everything قالدىم يالغۇز دەسەنگ

As a lyrical expression of grief, the song provides an emotional counterpoint to Kafka’s depiction of abandonment. Murat Nasyrov wrote Kaldym Yalguz addressing his late father after his death, showing loneliness as a response to this unfortunate loss. Nasyrov’s loneliness comes from the fact that his father is mourned and emotionally present even in his absence. Grief itself becomes a testament to empathy and human connection. In this sense, loneliness emphasizes humanity. 
Gregor’s loneliness emphasizes the opposite in The Metamorphosis. Gregor’s loneliness does not begin with death, but with forgetting. His family emotionally abandons him while he is still alive, refusing to even recognize his humanity. By the time Gregor dies, this forgetting is complete, and his death is met not with grief but with relief. While in Kaldym Yalguz, it’s emphasized how the 
author feels lonely after his father's death, in The Metamorphosis, the family forgetting Gregor emphasizes his loneliness, showing the stark contrast between humane and inhumane loneliness. 
The Father; Violence and Authority 
Gregor’s father represents the most explicit and obvious form of inhumanity in The Metamorphosis. Unlike the quiet neglect shown by the rest of the family members, his response to Gregor is shown by aggression and violence. From the moment the father finds out about Gregor’s transformation, he takes on the role of the enforcer. His priority was to “control” this situation, not to care for his son. His authority as head of the household allows him to dictate
how Gregor is perceived, not as a son who's deeply suffering, but as danger that must be managed. 
This dynamic reaches its most violent peak during the part of the story where the father begins hurling apples at Gregor. One apple becomes lodged in Gregor’s back, causing a wound that never heals and ultimately contributes to his death. The apple, once a symbol of nourishment, becomes the fruit of inhumanity, a violent weapon that leaves a severe wound. The father’s violence is deliberate, and not at all accidental, showing that Gregor has become a literal target once his humanity is denied. 
What makes this violence especially disturbing is that it is framed as necessary and as protection. The father believes he is defending the household from a perceived threat. By painting out Gregor as something less than human, the father convinces himself that his cruelty is his responsibility. This shows how authority can morally “justify” violence. Once Gregor is no longer recognized as a person, harm inflicted upon him becomes justified. 
This normalization of cruelty can be looked at through Hannah Arendt’s concept of the “banality of evil.” Arendt argues that harmful acts are often committed not out of hatred, but through obedience to duty and social roles that strip actions of moral reflection (Arendt, 1963). The father does not see himself as cruel, he sees himself as fulfilling his role as protector and authority figure. This makes his actions more unsettling, as they demonstrate how inhumanity can arise from ordinary structures of power and not necessarily malice. 
The tragedy is deepened by Gregor’s reaction to this violence. Even after being badly abused, Gregor does not feel anger or resentment toward his father. In stripping Gregor of his humanity, the father ultimately strips himself of his own. Kafka uses this dynamic to show that inhumanity is most dangerous when it is justified, normalized, and carried out in the name of duty. 
The Sister; Compassion Fatigue
Grete’s change is one of the most devastating parts of The Metamorphosis. At first, she is the only member of the family who seems to care for Gregor. She feeds him, cleans his room, and tries to communicate with him despite his transformation. Through these actions, Grete shows human empathy and care, which shows the emotional labor required to maintain connections with those who are suffering. 
However as time passes, Grete’s patience and empathy begin to fade. She becomes increasingly impatient and annoyed by Gregor’s presence. Her initial willingness to accommodate and care for him gradually transforms into resentment. This shift shows that empathy requires moral commitment. Even the most moral individuals can slip into inhumanity when compassion becomes inconvenient and tiring. 
Grete’s gradual resentment of Gregor is not motivated by evil or hatred. It comes from a sense of duty becoming tiring and inconvenient for her. When she finally says that “it has to go,” (Kafka, 1915) she strips Gregor of his final human connection. This moment represents not only Gregor’s true isolation but also the family’s final decision that he is no longer deserving of care and empathy. The subtlety of Grete’s inhumanity makes it all the more tragic, cruelty does not always show through in overt acts, but often in the withdrawal of affection and acknowledgment. 
This psychological phenomenon of moral fatigue can be better understood through the work of psychologist Daniel Goleman, who claims that sustained emotional labor can lead to compassion fatigue, in which caregivers gradually become less responsive to the needs of those they support (Goleman, 1995). Grete’s gradual withdrawal mirrors this concept; she does not consciously intend to harm Gregor, but the extra effort of caregiving, combined with the pressure to prioritize the household’s well-being leads to her moral and emotional exhaustion. 
The symbolic significance of Grete’s change extends beyond the family dynamic. Her transformation from the compassionate sister to an enforcer of Gregor’s exclusion reflects a broader critique of societal morality. Through Grete’s own metamorphosis, we can see that human empathy can be fragile, conditional, and easily overridden by convenience, social norms, or self-interest.
Ultimately, Grete’s change is a key theme of inhumanity in The Metamorphosis. Her inhumanity towards Gregor began quietly, not with aggression or hatred, but simply with the gradual withdrawal of empathy. Her change demonstrates that compassion is an active choice, requiring ongoing effort. Grete’s moral decline within the context of her initial kindness shows both the tragedy of Gregor’s isolation and the universal human tendency to neglect those who no longer align with our convenience or expectations. 
Language and Dehumanization 
Language plays a crucial role in the dehumanization of Gregor in The Metamorphosis. While Kafka’s narrator continues to refer to Gregor by name, the family’s spoken language increasingly avoids recognizing him as a person. This shift becomes explicit through Grete who decided to refer to Gregor as “it.” When she states that “it has to go” (Kafka, 1915), she linguistically erases Gregor’s identity as her brother, and overall as a person. This moment marks the final breakdown of familial empathy and confirms that Gregor is no longer perceived as human within his own home. 
Grete’s use of “it” is especially significant because she was once the most compassionate member of the family. Her language shift signals not shock or fear, but moral exhaustion and emotional withdrawal. By reducing Gregor to an object through speech, Grete frees herself and the rest of the family from moral responsibility toward him. Once Gregor is no longer named or acknowledged as a person, cruelty and neglect become easier to justify. 
This moment demonstrates how apparent inhumanity can be through linguistic erasure. Linguist George Lakoff argues that language shapes moral perception by framing how individuals understand responsibility and empathy (Lakoff, 1993). In Grete’s statement, language becomes a tool that enables exclusion and moral disengagement. By calling Gregor “it,” she draws out her own morally good brother as non-human, but in reality she is the one acting inhumane. 
Gregor's Death; The Final Act of Inhumanity
Gregor’s death marks the final and most disgusting act of inhumanity in The Metamorphosis. His family is relieved that he died and immediately think about redecorating, taking a trip, and overall planning their future. This narrative describes them as “light-hearted” and ready to enjoy a day outside the house following Gregor's death (Kafka, 1915), emphasizing how quickly they erase his presence from their lives. Overall, the tone of the book after Gregor’s death is very positive. They did not mourn his death at all, which shows their pure coldness and inhumanity toward their deceased, moral family member. 
This response reveals the ultimate inhumanity; forgetting. Gregor is neither mourned nor remembered, and his death is treated not as a loss but as a solution to the family’s inconvenience. Kafka’s portrayal highlights that inhumanity is not always violent or cruel in the conventional sense, sometimes it is quiet and even socially acceptable. By erasing him from memory, the family completes the ultimate dehumanization of their morally good family member Gregor. 
Kafka contrasts this with Gregor’s continued compassion until the very end. Even in his final moments, he worries about the comfort and happiness of his family. “He thought back of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister”, this quote shows that even while he was dying he thought of them with love and was willing to self-sacrifice for them, even though they were inhumanely cruel to him. This stark contrast shows how different morally Gregor and his family were. 
The psychological dimensions of the family's erasure can be connected to the concept of moral disengagement. Psychologist Albert Bandura describes how individuals can rationalize or ignore harm done to others in order to maintain self-image or social norms (Bandura, 1999). Gregor’s family effectively disengages morally from him, allowing themselves to treat him as disposable without feeling guilt or remorse. This aligns with the depiction of gradual dehumanization as a social phenomenon. 
Gregor’s erasure reflects broader societal patterns. Those who are no longer seen as productive, conforming, or useful often disappear from general memory, and their lives are undervalued. Kafka’s novella, in this sense, becomes a warning about the fragility of empathy and the ethical
responsibility to acknowledge all human beings for their humanity, even when they are different or “inconvenient”. 
Ultimately, Gregor’s death and the family’s response to it can teach people a lesson that compassion is deliberate, and sometimes difficult, but its absence is immoral and inhumane, because we as humans should have empathy. Gregor retains his humanity until the very end while his family loses theirs, which we overall as people should take as a lesson to care and empathize with others as much as possible, especially with our loved ones. 
Conclusion 
In The Metamorphosis, Franz Kafka presents a serious warning about how easily inhumanity becomes normalized. Gregor Samsa ironically does not lose his humanity when he becomes an insect, his family loses theirs when they stop recognizing him as human. Through guilt, loneliness, dehumanizing language, violence, emotional abandonment, and finally erasure after death, Kafka exposes how cruelty can exist quietly within ordinary life. Gregor becomes a cracked mirror reflecting the family’s moral decay; the more they turn away from him, the more shattered their own humanity becomes. 
Kafka’s The Metamorphosis remains powerful because it exposes how easily ordinary people participate in inhumanity without recognizing it as cruelty. Gregor’s family did not see themselves as villains, they saw themselves as tired and justified. This is exactly what makes their behaviour so disturbing. Kafka warns readers that inhumanity can often be justified as reasonable. 
In a world that increasingly values efficiency and convenience, The Metamorphosis is especially relevant now. Gregor’s story challenges readers to question how they treat those who are no longer useful, successful, or easy to care for. Kafka shows that humanity does not depend on contribution or appearance, but on the ability to recognize and care for others, even when it requires sacrifice.
