title: "How Is Islam Regarded in Contemporary Society?"
excerpt: "As someone who is a second-generation immigrant originally coming from Kazakhstan, I always had an immense interest in different cultures and traditions. Growing up in a country where most of the population is Muslim and then coming to multicultural Canada provided me with a unique perspective of Islam religion."

When my 74-year-old grandmother originally from a small village in Kazakhstan asked my mom for a Wi-Fi password and used a prayer-time app to set her Fajr alarm for Ottawa time I was in awe. I could see in real life how Islam could adapt to current trends. I realized that Islam is not an outdated religion; it is a faith that adapts and evolves with people’s lives and modern technology, and its values can have a meaningful and personal impact on anyone. Even my Azhetai who is deeply traditional, was using modern technology to practice her religion.

Despite these drastic changes in Islam, many people have stereotypes about the religion. Some people assume that Islam is very strict, outdated and opposed to the modern lifestyle. My little sister has friends whose families are Muslim; the girls wear hijabs and yet they are very modern, outspoken, outgoing as any other children. They watch Tiktok, share tips on makeup and chat about boys they like at school. When they come over to our house, my mom uses halal – checking app to make sure the food we offer meets their dietary needs. We use the same app for my grandma. Practicing Islam does not mean to be disconnected from the modern life. It means sharing your values in the society you live in and adapting to it. When my mom was an exchange student in the US during 9/11 attacks, she faced misunderstandings about Islam. Her classmates started saying that all Muslims are horrible and she had to speak up and explain that not all Muslims are the same and that the religion does not support violence. Her experience proves to my point that stereotypes have very deep roots, but people can change them by sharing truth and understanding (Zine, 2023).

Even though I am not strictly religious, I have become more interested about Islam as I have grown older. I appreciate certain ideas of Islam that my grandmother shares with me. They include “tayekel”, the concept that everything happens for a reason and we should trust in that. It helps me be more resilient in difficult situations. My mom often talks about “shukir”, the belief that we should be grateful for the things we have. It enables me to be thankful for even small things that I have in my life. I also have great respect for “hikwah”, a belief that people should learn from their past experiences and making further wise choices. These beliefs have a great impact on shaping me as a person and how I treat people.
What I found most interesting is how Muslims practice the religion using modern technology. People live stream on social media their hadjs to Mekkah or their Friday prayers “Juma Namas”. They use QR codes to donate zakat or listen to Qur’an through apps. During Ramadan, my Azhetai and mom used a QR code at our local mosque to make a donation. It was quick, easy, and meaningful; they wanted to pray for the soul of my late aunt who passed away last September. In my opinion, technology does not weaken people’s faith, it helps people blend their faith with their modern life (Pew Research Center, 2021).

To conclude, when I saw my Azhetai use a prayer app, watch my sister’s friends mix their faith and have fun, or hear how my mom and Azhetai donated through a QR code has changed my perspective to Islam. It is not an unbending system that was stuck in the past; it evolves with people’s lives. I have found myself wondering about “Shahadah” – the most important pillar in Muslim’s journey. I have not figured out my religious beliefs yet, but I already know that religion does not have to be strict. It can evolve and be very personal, adapting and guiding a person in their life in the ways they never expect (Esposito, 2011).
