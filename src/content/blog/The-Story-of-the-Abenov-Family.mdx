title: "The Rich Traditions of Kazakh Culture"
excerpt: "Across generations, my family’s story traces an unbroken thread of perseverance and transformation. It began with a great-grandmother born into a nomadic life who settled in rural Kazakhstan in search of survival, followed by a grandfather who left the countryside to build a future in the city. The next chapter saw a father who, rooted in urban life, made the bold choice to move his family across continents. My own journey, moving to Canada at nine years old, continues this enduring pattern of seeking new horizons. It is a reminder that each generation’s courage to adapt shapes the foundation for the next, turning struggle into strength and change into opportunity."

As someone who has always had the fortune to grow up surrounded by a wonderful support system and a thriving culture in the wonderful city of Almaty, Kazakhstan – a very rich and diverse city in culture, and known for its beautiful mountain views, I cannot help feeling grateful for everything I was given. 

My wonderful family consists of me, my parents, and my younger sister. My early childhood in Kazakhstan is filled with warm memories which I’m really grateful for. In 2018, at the age of nine, my family and I moved to Ottawa, Canada, which was one of the biggest turning points of my life. We moved to Canada because we sought better opportunities and a cleaner environment due to my asthma. After that, in 2021, when I was 12 years old, my family relocated to Gatineau, Quebec, a French speaking region. From ages 12-14, I went to a French school there. Now, at the age of 16, I’m back in Ottawa.

Even though uprooting my entire life and moving away from everything I’ve ever known posed challenges, it gave me a broader perspective on life. Also because of it, I’m now fluent in Russian, English, and proficient in French, which has been crucial for my self-development. Living in Almaty, Ottawa and Gatineau has helped me to fully embrace the multicultural experience, which helped me shape who I am as a multilingual and adaptable person. I’m very proud of being both Kazakh and Canadian. Currently, I am aiming to achieve my academic and career goals, with an average of 92% last year.

My dad, Chingiz Abenov, was born on November 12th, 1983, in the Kazakh SSR (Soviet Socialist Republic). He grew up in Almaty with an older sister, a younger brother, and his parents. His father was a construction foreman and an entrepreneur, and his mother was a housewife with a medicine degree. My father studied in Kazakh and Russian schools, so he is proficient in Kazakh and Russian. After graduating high school, he didn't exactly know what he wanted to do, so he decided it would be safe to study heat and gas supply engineering at the University of KazGASA, so that later on, he could work for his father’s company. After studying in KazGASA for 2 years, he decided it wasn’t for him, so he switched to KIMEP University to study finance, where he met my mom.

He graduated from university, and started working as a financial analyst. Two years later, I was born and six years after that, in 2014, my sister was born. For years, both my mom and my dad worked very, very hard for my sister and I to have a good life overall, and later on move to Canada. In 2018, all of their efforts paid off and we did. The move was really tough for them at first, but then because of how hardworking and determined they are, it all worked out. Right now, my dad works as a financial analyst in a company in Ottawa. I've learned the value of endurance and determination from my parents' perseverance and commitment. Their story serves as a reminder that success may be attained through perseverance and hard work, even in the face of major obstacles.

My grandfather, Zhetybai Abenov, was born on May 17th, 1954, officially in Uzbek SSR (Soviet Socialist Republic), however currently in the Turkestan Region of Kazakhstan. He grew up in a village along with his parents, an older sister and a younger brother. He moved to Almaty in his youth because he got into a polytechnic university there, and along with him, he moved his entire family to provide them with better opportunities. After graduation, he met my grandmother, who he later on married and had three children with.

My grandfather started as a construction foreman. However, after the collapse of the USSR, he decided to pursue entrepreneurship as well, due to the new opportunities that were opening up at that time. He was very successful in both of his careers. Unfortunately, later in his life, he started having health issues. As a result, my dad had decided to take him to South Korea for treatment. He sadly passed away there at the age of 63 in 2018. My grandfather’s story is a testament to resilience and ambition, his willingness to adapt to new circumstances and create opportunities for his family has taught me the importance of being proactive and determined.

My great-grandmother, Bibisara Abenova, was born in northern Kazakhstan in the 1920s as a nomad, but had left her home along with her family at the age of 8, for the hopes of finding an escape from the famine happening at that time. During that time, around 1932-1933, there was massive starvation across Kazakhstan, especially the northern regions. It is often regarded as the most difficult period for our country, with around a third of the population dying off quickly. Somehow, my great grandmother’s family had managed to make it all the way to the most southern region of Kazakhstan, Turkestan Region. Unfortunately, her parents decided to leave her in Turkestan with some acquaintances because they were afraid that if she continued the path with them, there would be a lack of resources for survival for all of them. So, her family continued their journey, while she stayed in Turkestan, and they never saw each other again.

In the end, she got married at eighteen to the man who grew up in the same family that raised her. Shortly after, he was collected as a USSR cavalry member and left for war to Germany and Japan. Thankfully, he came back and they had 3 children together. My great-grandmother was a housewife and also worked in the field, and my great-grandfather was a village accountant. In the 1970s, my great-grandfather unfortunately passed away, and shortly after, the whole family moved to Almaty. My great-grandmother passed away in 2006 due to old age. My great-grandmother’s survival story reminds me to stay strong in difficult times.

I look up to my ancestors’ qualities of strength, and resilience, which they all share. The wisdom that I gather from their life stories is that there is no challenge that cannot be overcome by hard work, bravery and persistence. As I continue to go through life and try to reach my goals, I will continue pushing myself in my purpose, adapting to the challenges ahead and most importantly, keeping hope like my ancestors did in their tough times.

Warmly,

Alua, proud KazNadian
