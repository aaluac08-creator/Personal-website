In many Kazakh households, becoming a wife means entering a system that expects silence, obedience, and complete sacrifice. Sexism and abuse are often hidden behind words like "respect" and "tradition."

My mom married at twenty-one and moved in with my dad's family. She tried to be respectful, helpful, and kind, but no matter what she did she was criticized and judged. Her accomplishments and opinions were dismissed, and her emotions were unwelcome. Even today the experience still hurts, and sadly it is not unusual. In many Kazakh families, especially in rural areas, kelins are expected to work all day -- cooking, cleaning, and caring for everyone without complaint. Research shows they can work up to seventeen or more hours a day, while constantly being judged by in-laws. Some are even punished physically for "disrespect" or "failure." That is not tradition; it is oppression.

In 2024, Kazakhstan faced a national tragedy that revealed how complex the problem is. Kuandyk Bishimbayev, a former government minister, was sentenced to twenty-four years in prison for torturing and murdering his wife, Saltanat Nukenova. Security footage showed him dragging her, beating her, and abusing her for hours inside a restaurant's private room. She later died from her injuries.

The public reaction was immediate and intense. People around the country demanded justice, and 150,000 citizens signed a petition for "Saltanat's Law." In April 2024 Kazakhstan passed stronger legislation to criminalize domestic violence. Yet I still ask myself: how could this happen in the first place? Why did so many witnesses look away? Why do some people still defend him?

People say Kazakh families are strong because of tradition. I believe no tradition should protect abuse. Respect should never mean suffering, and love should never require silence. As a Kazakh girl living in Canada, I am proud of my culture -- the language, food, music, and values. But I also believe in facing the problems honestly. Kelins should not be humiliated, silenced, or hurt to prove they belong. The future I want is one where women are respected as individuals, not just as "roles." I believe in a culture that helps women heal, not one that controls them.
