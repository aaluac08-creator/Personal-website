Hi! I'm Alua, a 17-year-old student based in Ottawa, Canada. I get genuinely excited about connecting with people from different countries, discovering what makes each culture unique, and using technology to tell meaningful stories.

This website is my home base for sharing that journey -- the wins, the fails, the late-night ideas, and the projects that keep me curious. Building it has been a hands-on way to learn modern web development while experimenting with AI and design.
