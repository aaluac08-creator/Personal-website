  <h1>Kazakh Names Explorer Project</h1>
  <p>
    This companion project extends Kaznames.info with an interactive experience built in React. It brings
    decades of Kazakh name registrations to life by animating how popular choices shift from month to month,
    spotlighting cultural influences and emerging trends that are easy to miss in static tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app ingests the archival dataset stored in <code>C:\Users\ching\Documents\gemini-projects\names-website\public\data</code>
    and transforms it into a bar chart race that advances through time. A shared playback engine synchronizes
    ranking changes, color transitions, and smooth easing so that each step feels cohesive rather than jarring.
    When I pause on a specific month, contextual tooltips and summary totals make it simple to compare the
    relative rise of each name.
  </p>
  <p>
    A second view, the Name Trend Explorer, focuses on one name at a time. It charts monthly counts, highlights
    peak moments, and surfaces transliteration variants so that families can see how a name evolved across
    regions and languages. Built-in language support (Kazakh, Russian, and English) uses the i18n utilities to
    keep labels consistent with the visitor’s preference.
  </p>
  <p>
    To try the current build, follow the <a href="https://kaznames.info/names-explorer" rel="noopener">Names Explorer prototype</a>
    link. I will wire it to the live deployment once the hosting pipeline is finalized.

    Upcoming work includes polishing accessibility for screen-reader cues, expanding the dataset with regional
    filters, and adding narrative callouts that pair with the visuals. Updates will appear here first so I can
    iterate on the copy before embedding the final screenshots and illustrations.
