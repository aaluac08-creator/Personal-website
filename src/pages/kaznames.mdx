    My goal was to learn coding and AI by working on a project — building my first website. My father gave me an   idea: analyzing baby names and their popularity trends could reveal fascinating insights about a country, especially Kazakhstan. What were the most popular names when I was born? Has my name ever been widely used? Why do certain names suddenly rise in popularity and then disappear?
  </p>
  <p>
    It sounded like a fun topic to explore, so I decided to create my first website about popular names in Kazakhstan: <b><a href="https://kaznames.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kaznames.info</a></b>.
  </p>
  <h3>Obtaining the Data</h3>
  <p>
    The official statistics website of Kazakhstan (<a href="https://stat.gov.kz/ru/instuments/name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stat.gov.kz</a>) 
    publishes the top 20 most popular baby names for every month, which provided an excellent data source for 
    this project. However, the site's structure presented challenges. The interface appears dated and relies 
    on Ajax technology in a way that made automated data collection difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    I needed to automate the extraction process rather than manually copying data from decades of records. 
    After considerable effort understanding how their system functioned, I successfully scraped the entire 
    dataset and saved it in CSV format. Following that, I transliterated all names from Cyrillic to English 
    and obtained the meaning of each one. 
  </p>
  <h3>The Website</h3>
  <p>
    The site offers both English and Russian versions that users can easily toggle between. I wanted to make 
    it accessible to audiences both within Kazakhstan and internationally.
  </p>
  <h3>Section 1: Monthly Top 20</h3>
  <p>
    This feature allows users to select any year and month to view the most popular names from that period. 
    Naturally, I first checked June 2008, the month I was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results were not surprising: my name, Alua, was not on the list. In fact, it has never appeared in the 
    top 20. Even within Kazakhstan, my name is quite rare. The most popular girl's name when I was born was 
    Aruzhan, which is my cousin's name.
  </p>
  <h3>Section 2: Name Trend Explorer</h3>
  <p>
    This section enables users to search for any name and examine how its popularity has evolved over time. 
    When I searched for Aruzhan, the site displayed the name's meaning - 'pure soul' or 'noble spirit,' from 'aru' (pure) and 'zhan' (soul), along with comprehensive statistics: 
    when it first entered the top 20, when it was last seen there, the total number of months it remained in 
    the rankings, when it peaked, and whether it ever reached the number one position.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data revealed that Aruzhan was the most popular girl's name in Kazakhstan for 136 months -- more than 
    ten years. The site also generates a chart showing the name's rank over time. Given that the dataset spans 
    nearly 100 years with monthly data points, I implemented a range slider allowing users to focus on specific 
    time periods of interest.
  </p>
  <h3>Insights from the Data</h3>
  <p>
    The data showed that Names are not merely labels 
    -- they reflect the broader social and historical context of their time.
  </p>
  <p>
    My mother has a friend named Indira who was born in 1985. The name Indira is not originally Kazakh, Russian, 
    or from any other major ethnic group in Kazakhstan. According to the data, this name did not appear in the 
    top 20 until November 1984, when it suddenly entered the rankings.
  </p>
  <p>
    After researching, I discovered that Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, was assassinated on 
    October 31, 1984. The event was apparently covered extensively in the USSR, so extensively that the name 
    Indira became popular in Kazakhstan. The trend did not fade quickly either -- the name remained in the 
    top 20 until 1990, reaching its peak in November 1988 when it was the seventh most popular girl's name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another interesting pattern emerged with the name Mayra, which originates from Arabic meaning "beloved." 
    However, in Kazakhstan, because the name sounds similar to the word for May, parents were significantly 
    more likely to give this name to babies born in May. The graph shows clear spikes during May each year, 
    with the name rarely appearing in the top 20 during other months.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many other patterns I am currently exploring. I plan to dedicate another post to these insights 
    where I can discuss them in greater detail.
  </p>
  <h3>Reflections</h3>
  <p>
    Building kaznames.info taught me that data can reveal narratives I had not anticipated. Every name carries 
    a history, and every trend has an explanation. It also revealed that my parents chose a name for me that 
    is uncommon.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am proud of this project. It is my first complete website, and it connects me to my culture in an 
    unexpected way. I learn a lot about web developement, working on the terminal, github, hosting website, utilize AI... The process of analyzing this data has given me a deeper appreciation for how names serve 
    as markers of cultural memory and social change.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are interested in how names reflect history and culture, I invite you to explore 
    <a href="https://kaznames.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kaznames.info</a>. Whether you are Kazakh 
    or simply curious about the intersection of data and cultural trends, the site offers a window into how 
    Kazakhstan has changed over the past century.
