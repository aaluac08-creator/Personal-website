  <p>
    The <a href="https://kaznames.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**kaznames.info**</a> project was a self-directed effort to learn **coding and AI** by building a website about popular names in **Kazakhstan** to discover historical and cultural insights.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Acquisition and Preparation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The data source was the official statistics website of Kazakhstan (<a href="https://stat.gov.kz/ru/instuments/name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stat.gov.kz</a>), which publishes the **top 20 popular baby names** monthly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Due to the site's dated interface and complex **Ajax technology**, automated data extraction was challenging.
    </li>
    <li>
      The solution involved successfully **scraping the entire dataset** for nearly 100 years of data, saving it as a CSV, and then **transliterating** names and obtaining their meanings.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Website Features</h3>
  <p>
    The site is available in both **English and Russian** for broad accessibility.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      **Section 1: Monthly Top 20:** Allows users to select any month and year.
      <p class="note">
        *Personal Check:* The author's name, **Alua**, has never appeared in the top 20, confirming its rarity.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      **Section 2: Name Trend Explorer:** Enables searching for any name to view its popularity evolution over time.
      <p>
        Features include displaying the name's meaning (e.g., Aruzhan means 'pure soul'), **comprehensive statistics** (total months in Top 20, peak rank), and a chart with a **range slider** for detailed analysis.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Insights</h3>
  <p>
    Data revealed that name trends are powerful reflections of social and historical events:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The name **Indira** suddenly entered the Top 20 in **November 1984**, immediately following **Indira Gandhi's assassination** (Oct 31, 1984), and remained popular until 1990.
    </li>
    <li>
      The name **Mayra** shows **clear popularity spikes every May**, attributed to its phonetic similarity to the word for the month of May in Kazakhstan.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>

    This project served as my **first complete website**, providing deep learning in web development, terminal use, GitHub, hosting, and AI application. It connected me to my culture and demonstrated how data can reveal **unanticipated historical narratives**.
